  description: Our paper shows that it is possible to perform domain-restricted low-shot reconstruction of lensless computational images. We demonstrate an improvement in the reconstruction performance of untrained neural networks by providing very few domain-restricted images for pre-training. We were able to achieve faster convergence with higher reconstruction fidelity with as low as 10 images for pre-training.

  description: "Our paper shows that lensless images can be reconstructed using under-parameterized networks with less than 10 thousand parameters. We compare the reconstruction performance with untrained over-parameterized networks having over 30 million parameters. We employ a physics-informed consistency loss function to optimize our network, leading to faster convergence and better reconstruction quality."

  description: "We developed GANs for simultaneous foreground and background colorization, with a dense adaptive fusion network. Our method outperformed existing ones with limited training data. We also introduced a new human-visual realism test to address limitations in traditional metrics."
